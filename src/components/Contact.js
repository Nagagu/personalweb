      <p>
        I am looking for a creative project that allows me to express my ideas
        that poses new challenges every day and that makes me keep learning. I
        have a preference for beautiful and original projects but if you work
        for a bank we can always negotiate it ðŸ˜‰ My goal in my work is to get to
        develop products from beginning to end, to be part of the decisions at
        the creative, artistic and marketing level, as well as the code
        architecture from the front to the back.
      </p>
