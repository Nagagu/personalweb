Welcome to my personal web. Here you can find everything I am learning specially React which is what I like the most.

Each project contain its own Readme file explaining the purpose and the materials used in each one.

I hope you to enjoy!

## How to start the project

This command runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
